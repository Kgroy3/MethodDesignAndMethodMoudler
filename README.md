# MethodDesignAndMethodMoudler
# Modular Calculator - Java

## Features
- Modular methods for calculator operations
- Method overloading demonstration
- Exception handling for divide-by-zero
- Utility methods for reusability
- Pass-by-value behavior example
- Clean and interview-ready code

## Concepts Covered
- Method Overloading
- Return vs Void
- Stack Memory
- Exception Handling
- Modular Programming

## How Java Passes Parameters
Java passes parameters by value, meaning a copy of the variable is sent to methods.
